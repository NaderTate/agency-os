description: Render the whole agency pipeline, every deal, stage, next action, pipeline value, and signed MRR.

# /status

The agency at a glance, computed live from the client files.

## Procedure

1. Glob `clients/*.md` and read each one **except `_template.md`**. Parse the fenced `meta` block at the top of each (name, stage, vertical, deal_value, deal_mrr, next_action).
2. **Compute the numbers** (state them, don't hand-wave):
   - **Open pipeline value** = sum of `deal_value` for every client whose stage is `lead`, `researching`, `proposal-sent`, or `call-booked`.
   - **Signed MRR** = sum of `deal_mrr` for every client whose stage is `won` or `delivering`.
   - **Annualized signed** = Signed MRR × 12 (one-line aside).
   - Exclude any client with stage `lost` from both totals.
3. **Render the board**, grouped by stage in pipeline order (`lead → researching → proposal-sent → call-booked → won → delivering`, then `lost` last if any). For each client show one line: `Business (vertical): $value setup / $mrr per mo. Next: <next_action>`.
4. **Surface the focus:** below the board, list the 1-3 most urgent next actions (deals furthest along the funnel first, a `call-booked` follow-up outranks a fresh `lead`).
5. Keep it to one screen. This is the cold-open shot and the closing shot of the walkthrough, so it must be clean and instantly legible.

(After you `/intake` a new lead, that deal's `deal_value` is added to the open pipeline total, so the number you see here moves the moment a lead enters the system.)
